# PythonToolForge

This is where I am forging my python weapons for Science/ to assist me in optimizing my python workflow in the Physics/EE work that I do. 
I am not a programmer so these are not optimized code that should end up directly into the main libraries that the tools are being forged. But may contribute to those libraries developers integrating the ideas that I have forged here into their libraries. And anyone who wants to contribute to this forge is welcome to.  A huge shootout to those who have posted their code online and asked/answered questions on StackOverFlow. Those contributions are allowing me to make my contributions. 

Note! At this time, I am still new to GitHub / also I can’t spell and my grammar is terrible so yeah.
## What tools are being Crafted
Below is a list of things that are or will be undergoing forging as I get around to them (I am back in college right now so yeah; time crunch):
* A more automated [Lampdfiy](http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/utilities/lambdify.html) for the [SymPy Library](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
* A more integrated/automated toolset for scientific plots in matplotlib 
* Plot/Image interaction in the notebook for matplotlib plots
* Guide for Creating classes through multiple cells in the notebook (yeah I had to do this for a project; don’t ask, not proud of doing it;  but it is an unfortunate evil that needs to addressed)
* Some wrapping of [scipy.intergrate.ode](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html#scipy.integrate.ode) into a more bound up structure, with added tools for Courant number and sampling outputs. 
* Integration of [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) and [yt](http://yt-project.org/) just as [pandas and matplotlib](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html) are.
